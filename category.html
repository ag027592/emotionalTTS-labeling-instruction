  <h2>Emotion Category Identification</h2>
  <p>In this task, you listen to a speech sample and determine which single emotion is most clearly expressed. Options include: Angry, Sad, Happy, Surprised, Neutral, and Other. If "Other" is selected, annotators are asked to briefly describe the perceived emotion in their own words.</p>
  <p>The sample clips are grouped by emotion labels to demonstrate how different emotions typically sound in speech.</p>
